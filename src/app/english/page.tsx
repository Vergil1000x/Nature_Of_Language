        In todayâ€™s globalised world, one cannot remain monolingual if he/she
        wants to seriously improve themselves; irrespective of whether in their
        career or personal lives, since each part of the world has its own
        specialty. Every new language is like unlocking DLC of the world: it
        will unlock the opportunities of certain regions, whether for
        travelling, working, learning about various cultures and histories,
        improving self expression, creating code languages with international
        friends or simply improving one&apos;s own brain capacity. With the near
        complete invasion of the entire world, English is a language thrust upon
        most people, aside from their own mother tongue which they naturally
        acquire. But a question that any language learner inevitably finds
        themselves asking is: What is the best way to learn a language?
